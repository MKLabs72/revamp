# RVNWL / Revamp Protocol – Architecture Overview

## Overview

RVNWL’s architecture is designed for maximal modularity, transparency, and on-chain sustainability. The protocol consists of two primary smart contracts—**Revamp** and **ShareHolding**—deployed immutably and intended for seamless integration with multiple independent frontends.

### Key Components

#### 1. Revamp Contract (`Revamp.sol`)
- **Purpose:** Handles the recycling (“revamp”) of illiquid tokens into native blockchain currency.
- **Features:**
  - **Asset Listing & Delisting:** Anyone can list new assets at a custom revamp rate (premium) for native currency; delisting is permissionless, incurring a protocol fee.
  - **Deposit & Burn:** Users deposit both the listed asset and matching native currency. The asset is burned (irreversibly removed from circulation); the native currency is distributed among active pool participants.
  - **Rate Enforcement:** Revamp rates are set by the lister and enforced by the smart contract at every join.

#### 2. ShareHolding Contract (`ShareHolding.sol`)
- **Purpose:** Manages on-chain shareholding and proportional distribution of protocol revenue.
- **Features:**
  - **Fixed 100-Share Pool:** Ownership never leaves the contract; shares can only be joined or exited through contract logic.
  - **Revenue Distribution:** All listing/delisting fees, and all revamp activity, are allocated directly to current shareholders in real time.
  - **Non-Transferrable Shares:** Participation is strictly contract-governed; no off-chain admin, no token trading.

#### 3. Frontend Integration
- **Reference UI:** See [rvnwl.com](https://rvnwl.com) for the initial conceptual implementation.
- **Open Integration:** Any frontend can interface with the deployed contracts. ABIs and sample code provided for Ethers.js/Web3.js.

### Security & Upgradeability

- **Immutability:** Contracts are deployed with no admin keys, no upgrade mechanisms—ensuring trustless and censorship-resistant operation.
- **Permissionless:** All listing, joining, and reward functions are open and enforced by code.
- **Auditable Logic:** All actions are executed on-chain, with full event emission for transparency and analysis.

### Extensibility

- Designed for easy forking and customization (e.g., alternate fee models, governance hooks, additional analytics).
- DAO governance logic can be layered atop the base contracts or handled by external modules as community needs evolve.
