A decentralized, open-source smart contract protocol for recycling illiquid tokens into native blockchain currency, powered by an immutable, shareholding revenue model. No speculation, no admin keys—just algorithmic, on-chain liquidity restoration.

---

## ✨ What is RVNWL / Revamp Protocol?

RVNWL is the first protocol to **recycle** illiquid tokens into native blockchain currency at premium, preset rates—transforming stagnant capital into instant, transparent liquidity.

- **Immutable smart contracts** — No admin keys, no backdoors.
- **Shareholding Pool** — 100 fixed shares, never leaving the contract, earning revenue from every listing, delisting, pool join, and revamp order.
- **Open Listing** — Anyone can list any supported asset and set its revamp rate.
- **No Hype, No Persuasion** — Outcomes are code-driven and on-chain. Participation is voluntary; rewards depend on ongoing network activity.

## 💡 Key Features

- **Burn-to-Reclaim:** Permanently removes illiquid tokens from circulation in exchange for native currency.
- **Algorithmic Revenue Sharing:** All protocol fees and native currency inflows are proportionally distributed to the 100-share pool.
- **DAO-Ready:** Designed for community governance and extension.
- **Open Integration:** Plug-and-play for wallets, dashboards, DAO portals, and new assets.

## 🚀 Quickstart

### 1. Deploying Smart Contracts

#### Using Hardhat (Local Testnet)

bash
cd contracts
npm install
npx hardhat test      # Run unit tests

# To deploy locally
npx hardhat node      # Start local network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost

##### Using Remix IDE (Browser-Based)
1. Go to [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)

2. Import the contracts from the /contracts directory (upload or use GitHub import).

3. Compile contracts in the Solidity Compiler tab.

4. Deploy and interact via the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.

5. Set environment/network as appropriate (Injected Web3 for testnet/mainnet).

**Tip:** Remix is recommended for direct, visual deployments and on-chain interaction.

### 2. Frontend (React App)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
Visit http://localhost:3000 to interact with your local frontend.
